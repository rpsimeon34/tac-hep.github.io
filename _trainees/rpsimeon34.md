    I am working on the set up and configuration of an analysis facility at UW-Madison. This work is being 
    done in collaboration with scientists at Fermilab and University of Nebraska/IRIS-HEP. Plans include installing 
    JupyterHub, as well as configuring distributed computing access to the UW-Madison both CPU and GPU resources at 
    the CMS Tier-2 and the Center for High Throughput Computing facility. I am investigating the use of HT-Condor 
    and Kubernetes. Once functional, I will be working on an LHC physics analysis that exploits the resources and motivates
    further facility development.

### Biography

I am a second-year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, working in the CMS group and advised by Professor Sridhara Dasu.

### Projects

Ryan Simeon is contributing to the Analysis Facilities effort within USCMS computing working with Fermilab scientists Dr. Lindsey Gray and Dr. Nick Smith. He is developing tools that make it easier for physicists to harness large amounts of computing power and big data for scientific analyses. In particular, he is working on a JupyterLab interface that presents users with an environment pre-configured for modern Python-based data analysis and high throughput computing. The work involves integrating with the CMS Tier-2 at UW-Madison and the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) resources. This includes developing a repository of example and tutorial code that guides users from first interaction with contemporary High Energy Physics packages to performing data analysis on a computing cluster (https://github.com/rpsimeon34/wisc-af-examples). He is also contributing to the fsspec-xrootd project (https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/fsspec-xrootd), which is used in the Analysis Facilities community to remotely access CMS simulation and experimental data.
